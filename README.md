PSRansom

PSRansom is a PowerShell Ransomware Simulator with C2 Server capabilities. This tool helps you simulate encryption process of a generic ransomware in any system on any system with PowerShell installed on it. Thanks to the integrated C2 server, you can exfiltrate files and receive client information via HTTP.

All communication between the two elements is encrypted or encoded so as to be undetected by traffic inspection mechanisms, although at no time is HTTPS used at any time.
